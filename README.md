## SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Analysis – IBM Data Science Capstone

This repository contains all notebooks and deliverables for the IBM Data Science Capstone Project.
The goal is to analyze Falcon 9 launch data, identify factors influencing landing success, and build a predictive classification model.

## Project Contents

API Data Collection: Retrieve SpaceX launch records using the REST API

Web Scraping: Extract landing outcome data from an HTML table

Data Wrangling: Clean, standardize, and merge datasets

EDA (Visualization): Explore trends using scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps

EDA (SQL): Run SQL queries to analyze payloads, boosters, and outcomes

Folium Map: Build an interactive map of launch sites and landing results

Plotly Dash: Create an interactive dashboard for deeper analysis

Machine Learning: Train and evaluate classification models (Decision Tree performed best)
